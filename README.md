# 6.0020-Java

### Intro
This repository's code comes from the MIT's Opencourse Ware 6.002 introduction to Java.

The idea of the course is to start getting a grip into java's principles, for that, there are 7 lectures, and each one has its own Assigment.

There is no resume for this course, code files (.java) are not toroughly explained, they just represent some personal notes from various segments from the course.
